SECURITY ISSUES

WARNING: Web Interface to Octave have poor protection against
execution of unwanted or dangerous code on the server. 
Thus it is NOT supposed to run on servers with important or secret
data without additional security means.

OPERATING SYSTEM

Currently WebOctave is supposed to run in Linux-like operating
systems. Installing it to non-Linux system would need some additional
work and for the present is not supported.

NECESSARY SOFTWARE

WebOctave needs:
1) WWW server with PHP>=5 support (ex. Apache)
2) SQL server (ex. MySQL, may be remote)
3) Octave>=3.0.0

These software are available in most Linux distributions. 

INSTALLATION

Installation procedure:
1) Unpack webctave archive to a directory available to be accessed by
   WWW server.
1a) Depend on your permission policy, you may have to change 
    premissions, in order to files be accessible by WWW server.
    Particularly, you have to change permissions to directories "data"
    and "Logs" to be writeable by WWW server.
2) Create database to be used by WebOctave.
3) Set database entries. Use "setup/db.sql" script, but edit it first
   to supply the database name.
4) Copy "config/config.php.example" to "config/config.php".
5) Edit "config/config.php" and set your preferences. 
   You have to set database data.
Now your WebOctave environment is ready to work and should be
accessible by any web browser.


USAGE

Web Interface to Octave is supposed to run Octave commands from a web
browser. Browser have to set cookies on. 

1) Commands and plots

Octave commands may be run in Commands tag. User have to enter command into
textbox, then click Submit to Octave button. Computations would be
done on the server side and output will be shown below command
textbox.

Attention: There is time and space limit imposed on tasks (look at
"config/config.php.example). 

Plots will be placed also in Plots tag. They may be examined and downloaded.

Attention: WebOctave supports only basic set of plot commands (plot,
mesh,semilogx,...). Any plot-altering commands (xlabel, legend,...)
will not work. hold on/off works, but you will have all partial plots
in output.

Commands, output and plots for are preserved between sessions. Look at
next section for more information.

2) Users

Web Interface to Octave supports both anonymous and non-anonymous
users. New user may be created in Account tag.

Both anonymous and logged users have the same rights. However, if
anonymous user wants to have his session saved, he have to use the
same browser on the same computer. Logged user has his session
preserved on any computer.

Attention: Session informations are deleted after long period of
inactivity (30 days).

3) User-defined functions

User may define his own Octave's functions. Functions may be created
and managed by Functions tag. User may change old functions by Show
Functions subtag or define new with Define Function subtag.  Remember
to end function with "endfunction" command, not just "end".  

New functions may be also defined in Commands tag directly in Octave
commands textbox. After clicking Submit to Octave they will be created
and may be used in the computation immediately.

4) Files

User may govern his files by Files tag. For the present it is possible
to examine files or to delete them.
